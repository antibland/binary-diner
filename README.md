# Mel‘s Binary Diner

Welcome to the Mel‘s. I‘m Mel, the owner. Sit anywhere you‘d like. We‘re never very busy. Hungry? We only got like four things so far. They take time to make since Andy has a day job. Please be patient.

## What is this about?

I‘ll be Andy for a second and give ol‘ Mel a break. I‘ve worked on the web for twenty years now and keep seeing the same issues over and over…and over again. Everyone knows there is amazing documentation out there and that we should all be thoroughly reading every second. We know we need to read more! The thing is, documentation can be very dry and is not always the best way for people to learn. I‘m taking a different approach and sticking to this diner metaphor as a vehicle for learning. Hopefully you‘ll be a little offended at something you see here. Everything‘s so safe and watered-down these days.

## Contributing?

Mel here. Like I says, these examples take some time to cook up. Why don‘t you get off your keister and help out for once? The Diner was built using React, whatever that is, and doesn‘t use Redux, whatever that is. It sounds a lot like acid reflux, a condition from which I suffer. We‘re looking for dishes that are done wrong over and over, for years, but should be right by now. Think of practical examples that can help a lot of people when cooked right. I gotta get back to the kitchen, kid. Thanks for coming to Mel‘s. Tip your waiter and star us on GitHub.
